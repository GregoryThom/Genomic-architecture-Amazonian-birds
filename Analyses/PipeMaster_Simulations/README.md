This folder contains scripts to run the model based approach implemented in Pipemaster and Keras.

Foder 10kb - Scripts to simulated genetic data under distinct demographic models, train and test a neural network using Keras for model classification and parameter estimation, and estimate parameters for observed data considering multiple 10kb windows across the genome. A pipeline to conduct parameter estimation for areas of the genome assigned to distinct slection regimes by diploS/HIC is also provided.

Folder 100kb_adjusted - Pipeline for model classification and parameter estimation for 100 kbp windows of the genome. This approach is similar to the 10kbp, but is designed to estimate demographic parameter for individual windows of the genome

scripts - This folder contains scripts used to convert vcf files into fasta alignemnts using the reference of each species
